# Phishing
A Sophisticated ML Framework for the Accurate Detection of Phishing Websites

Phishing is an increasingly sophisticated form of cyberattack. Designing an ML framework that can provide generalized performance over a broad variety of datasets is a challenge.
In this project, a stacking ensemble classifier is constructed which can harness the capabilities of a variety of different ML algorithms and provide generalized performance. A greedy-based selection mechanism is employed to obtain the optimal combination of weak learners while the recursive feature elimination algorithm is employed to extract the most representative features for individual classifiers. Finally, a neural network, capable of learning complex non-linear relationships in the data, was utilized as the meta-learner.  
The performance of the developed system was tested on 4 different phishing datasets. A paper is written on this work which is currently under review.
